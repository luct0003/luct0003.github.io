        <p>Hi, my name is Zack and I’m a student at Algonquin College in the Interactive Media Design program. I’m 21 years old and was born in Ottawa, December 8<sup>th</sup>, 1999. I went to school at Hillcrest High School and Norman Johnston Alternate Program, finally achieving my diploma last year from the OCDSB Launch Program at Algonquin. I’m exited to finally experience post-secondary and get to learn about things that interest me.</p>
        <p>My future aspirations are to be involved with media, either music or sports, and build a brand. I love rap, r&b, punk, indie and old school rock. For sports I grew up playing hockey, golf, and soccer. I follow the <abbr title= "National Football League">NFL</abbr>, <abbr title= "National Hockey League">NHL</abbr>, <abbr title= "National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing">NASCAR</abbr>, <abbr title= "Formula One">F1</abbr>, IndyCar, and occasionally <abbr title= "Professional Golf Association">PGA Tour</abbr> golf. My goal is to be able to work alongside my interests and build a social media presence. <strong>I’m very excited</strong> for to learn a bunch of new skills to help me on my way to achieving my goals.</p>
